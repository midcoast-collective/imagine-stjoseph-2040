                <p>
                    It’s 2040 and St. Joseph has the top-rated school system in Missouri and the highest concentration of skilled workers with post-high school training in the state. When you visit our early childhood centers you see children not only getting an academic head start but working together and solving problems. Missouri Western State University is an internationally-recognized institution focusing on future-shaping programs related to population health and biotechnology, attracting students from around the world. The percentage of families living in poverty has been sliced in half because St. Joseph has addressed access to basic needs like transportation, food and safe housing and placed health care specialists in the field to help those who need help, and hope. In St. Joseph, we don’t just say “everyone belongs,” we live it by ensuring that those on the margins who need the most help get it in the most innovative ways possible.

                <h2 class="rounded teal">Invest in People</h2>
                <p>Our greatest return-on-investment comes from investing in our people. Ensuring that all children are ready to learn, as well as investing in state-of-the-art K-16 education, will cultivate a dynamic next-generation workforce. Providing two-year degrees and certificate programs, as well as four-year and graduate degrees, will enable current and future workers to retool and be prepared for new economy jobs. We will face poverty head-on by addressing the root causes, not just the symptoms. Whether it’s the issue of poverty, mental health or addiction, we will make sure resources and systems are in place that encourage all residents to reach their full potential. Investing in people now, will reap benefits in our future.</p>
